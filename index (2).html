        <div>You can move these elements between these two containers</div>
        <div>Moving them anywhere else isn't quite possible</div>
        <div>Anything can be moved around. That includes images, <a href='https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula'>links</a>, or any other nested elements.

      <div id='right-defaults' class='container'>
        <div>There's also the possibility of moving elements around in the same container, changing their position</div>
        <div>This is the default use case. You only need to specify the containers you want to use</div>
        <div>More interactive use cases lie ahead</div>
        <div>Moving <code>&lt;input/&gt;</code> elements works just fine. You can still focus them, too. <input placeholder='See?' /></div>

    <label for='hy'>There are plenty of events along the lifetime of a drag event. Check out <a href='https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula#drakeon-events'>all of them</a> in the docs!</label>

        <div>As soon as you start dragging an element, a <code>drag</code> event is fired</div>
        <div>Whenever an element is cloned because <code>copy: true</code>, a <code>cloned</code> event fires</div>
        <div>The <code>shadow</code> event fires whenever the placeholder showing where an element would be dropped is moved to a different container or position</div>
        <div>A <code>drop</code> event is fired whenever an element is dropped anywhere other than its origin <em>(where it was initially dragged from)</em></div>
      </div>
      <div id='right-events' class='container'>
        <div>If the element gets removed from the DOM as a result of dropping outside of any containers, a <code>remove</code> event gets fired</div>
        <div>A <code>cancel</code> event is fired when an element would be dropped onto an invalid target, but retains its original placement instead</div>
        <div>The <code>over</code> event fires when you drag something over a container, and <code>out</code> fires when you drag it away from the container</div>
        <div>Lastly, a <code>dragend</code> event is fired whenever a drag operation ends, regardless of whether it ends in a cancellation, removal, or drop</div>
